A separate README within details how to run this project.

This was a group project conducted with some fellow students
in early 2022. I was particularly passionate about this project
as I was able to chose a topic and tailor the dataset to a topic
that I enjoy greatly: Dungeons and Dragons.

I was in charge of creating the database design (ER Diagram, entity
relationships, decisions regarding what to include and not), manupulating
the data such that it could be used in our database, implementing
the SQLite database itself and writing queries.

Most of the frontend features were implementing by the other group members.
