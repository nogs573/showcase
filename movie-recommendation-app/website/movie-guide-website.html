				<h1>Why Use Movie Guide?</h1>
					<p>Think back to the last time you wanted to watch a movie but didn’t know what to watch. If you’re anything like me, you probably spent hours scrolling just to end up watching something you weren’t even interested in in the first place. Well look no further, I have the perfect app for you. Introducing the Movie Guide, this is an app designed to make your movie selection quick and easy. With a list of over 400 movies, this powerful app helps narrow down the selection using your own personal interests so that you never have to spend extra time looking for something to watch. If you’re unsure what you’re feeling one day, you can take a simple quiz that takes less then 5 minutes to complete which will find a small selection of movies tailored to your answers. All movies also provide information on the selected movie such as rating and summary. Download the Movie Guide now and never worry about what you’re going to watch ever again! </p>

                    <p>Afaz worked with all three layers of the architecture: UI, logic, and Querying the Database. It is amusing how one can integrate other people’s work to develop their features. He learned various UI aspects like using different Layouts and constraints, passing data between activities, etc. One of the course concepts that he found really useful was technical debt, one must keep this in mind while working on the project to avoid pushing release dates.</p>

                        <p>Testing had been a very unknown software aspect for all of us to the date before this course. So throughout this project, Mostafa tried to bolster overall team confidence by doing the critical part which happened to set up tools' environments to do testing. Different libraries such as Mockito, Junit and Espresso helped us simplify our tests. While working with such a lovely team, I did get chances to hone my skills in overly interesting areas which are Database implementation and UI in Android studio especially did enjoy playing with spring and strut.</p>

        <h1 class="title">What the chart means</h1>
		<p>As is clear from the chart above, our estimates got better through the course. The estimate for iteration 1 that was wildly off can be explained by the fact that we were inexperienced when it came to estimating how long a single feature would take to implement. Now that we have implemented some basic building blocks of an Android app from the ground up, we have a better idea of how long things take. We overestimated the time setting up a database would take, among other things. The much more accurate estimate of iteration 3 is due to the fact that we had a very good idea of what was left to be done and had gauged how long certain types of features take.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Postmortem</h1></p>
			<h2 class="subtitle is-5">What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?</h2>
			
			<p> 
				During the development of our project, the database was the hardest thing to implement and took the most amount of time. The database being one of the main components of the project led to a lot of bugs/issues during development.
				Specifically, we had significant technical debt because we implemented a real database using SQLite in Iteration 1. Later, we found out that it was too highly coupled with Android context and with code that is not completely based in Java. Paying off this debt at the beginning of iteration 2 caused some time and resources that could have been used towards adding new features to be spent elsewhere.
				Creating the UI for many of the activities did not require as much time as we expected. Although the unfamiliarity of Android Studio caused some issues in the beginning, as group members became more familiar with the IDE, the development became a lot smoother and less time consuming. Members were better able to contribute to parts of the project others worked on as everyone became more comfortable with Android Studio, leading to a more seamless/cohesive development process.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="subtitle is-5">How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?</h2>
			<p>
				The project had to change from our initial vision at iteration 0 due to various factors. We are all students taking many classes and have a limited amount of hours to dedicate to a project like this. We were ambitious during the planning phase and created 13 feature issues. The scope creep of certain features became apparent near the end of Iteration 3 and we decided it was more prudent to move the remaining low-priority features to a “Future” milestone. This allowed us to spend more time polishing the current state of our application and writing the required tests.
				Some of these low-priority features that we mentioned in the vision statement would have taken many more work hours than we had access to. In particular, the watchlist, sharing to social media, and the ability to upvote and downvote movies have all been pushed to a future milestone.
				The search feature also became a larger part of the application during the course of development, so the usage of our application after iteration 3 is largely focused on having a database of fake movies that can be filtered by using various attributes or by searching by name.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="subtitle is-5">What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?</h2>
			
			<p>
				We learned that communication is the most important aspect of project development. Also, for efficient collaboration, version control needs to be continuous and consistent using a centralized repository where people can push the code that they worked on individually. 
				Next time, we will start to ensure that the code we write for new features is as lowly coupled as possible so that merge conflicts are easier to fix. We will also plan every user story and dev task at the beginning of the iteration and avoid deviating from that plan. During the iteration, we will properly track the amount of time spent on each dev task. We will also write tests while we are implementing new user stories/features instead of waiting until the end of an iteration.
				We will keep dividing tasks amongst group members and holding weekly meetings to keep track of progress on various features and offer support to other team members.
