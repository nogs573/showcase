## Machine Learning

This section showcases my interest in machine learning and willingness
to delve into more advanced subject matter, including those that require
the application of higher-level mathematics. I found that creating a jupyter
notebook to organize my coding work and being able to produce results by
executing python code inside it to be very satisfying. Writing these documents
in markdown increased my desire to make my documentation readable and neatly organized.
